/*
In many ways, Finder is a sadly unergonomic software.
I suggest you realize the feat of doing even worse by
implementing your own Finder.

Let's go for the worst user experience of history!

If you select a directory (except for ../):

A menu will display the following options:

    Open : to open the directory;
    Copy : to open a new prompt and to perform a copy of the directory into another directory;
    Move : to open a new prompt and to move the directory into another directory;

If you select a file:

    A menu will display the following options:

        Open : Read and display the content of the file;
        Copy : to open a new prompt and to perform a copy of the file into another place;
        Move : to open a new prompt and to move the file into another file;

function finder() {
  // Your code here
}

module.exports = finder;
